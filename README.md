# AInalysis
Hello and welcome to Ainalysis, my AI powered live F1 data analysis software.
This program took about 1 and a half weeks in total, from research to the final product.

# Information
I have omitted my huggingface API key for the AI mode for obvious reasons, so that wont work until you get your own and put it in there.
You can get one of your own at (https://huggingface.co/), or drop me a message!

This program accesses the OpenF1 API/Database for the live updating data from F1. (https://openf1.org/)

I use tkinter for my interface, along with some other image files to tie the main look together.

# Requirements
As this is a python program, there are some required libraries for my program to work properly. Please see requirements.txt.

# --
Feel free to give me any feedback as this is my first ever proper application written in python and there is definitley some room for improvement!
My discord is **elzi_**  - feel free to drop me a message :)
